The official JavaScript package for the [Patch API](https://www.patch.io).

## Documentation

For a complete API reference, check out [Patch's API Reference.](https://docs.patch.io)

## Installation

### NPM

```shell
npm install @patch-technology/patch --save
```

### Yarn

```shell
yarn add @patch-technology/patch
```

### Requirements

- Node 10+

## Usage

### Configuration

After installing the package, you'll have to configure it with your API key which is available from the API key page in the Patch dashboard:

```javascript
// ES6+
import Patch from '@patch-technology/patch';
const patch = Patch('key_test_1234');

// ES5
var patch = require('@patch-technology/patch').default('key_test_1234');
```

#### Peer dependencies

For environments that do not include the Node Standard Library, such as React Native, you will need to install the listed peer dependencies in order for the package to work as expected. You can install the peer dependencies by running:

```
npm install install-peers
```

### Orders

In Patch, orders represent a purchase of carbon offsets or negative emissions by mass.
Place orders directly if you know the amount of carbon dioxide you would like to sequester.
If you do not know how much to purchase, use an estimate.
You can also create an order with a maximum desired price, and we'll allocate enough mass to
fulfill the order for you.

[API Reference](https://docs.patch.io/#/?id=orders)

#### Examples

```javascript
// Create an order - you can create an order
// providing either mass_g or total_price_cents_usd, but not both

// Create order with mass
const mass = 1000000; // Pass in the mass in grams (i.e. 1 metric tonne)
patch.orders.createOrder({ mass_g: mass });

// Create an order with a maximum total price
const totalPriceCentsUSD = 500; // Pass in the total price in cents (i.e. 5 dollars)
patch.orders.createOrder({ total_price_cents_usd: totalPriceCentsUSD });

// Retrieve an order
orderId = 'ord_test_1234'; // Pass in the order's id
patch.orders.retrieveOrder(orderId);

// Place an order
const orderId = 'ord_test_1234'; // Pass in the order's id
patch.orders.placeOrder(orderId);

// Cancel an order
const orderId = 'ord_test_1234'; // Pass in the order's id
patch.orders.cancelOrder(orderId);

// Retrieve a list of orders
const page = 1; // Pass in which page of orders you'd like
patch.orders.retrieveOrders({ page });
```

### Estimates

Estimates allow API users to get a quote for the cost of compensating a certain amount of CO2. When creating an estimate, an order in the `draft` state will also be created, reserving the allocation of a project for 5 minutes. If you don't place your draft order within those 5 minutes, the order will automatically be cancelled.

[API Reference](https://docs.patch.io/#/?id=estimates)

#### Examples

```javascript
// Create a mass estimate
const mass = 1000000; // Pass in the mass in grams (i.e. 1 metric tonne)
patch.estimates.createMassEstimate({ mass_g: mass });

// Create a flight estimate
const distance_m = 9000000; // Pass in the distance traveled in meters
patch.estimates.createFlightEstimate({ distance_m: distance_m });

// Create a shipping estimate
const distance_m = 9000000;
// Pass in the shipping distance in meters, the transportation method, and the package mass
patch.estimates.createShippingEstimate({
  distance_m: distance_m,
  transportation_method: 'air',
  package_mass_g: 1000
});

// Create a vehicle estimate
const distance_m = 9000000;
// Pass in the shipping distance in meters and the model/make/year of the vehicle
patch.estimates.createVehicleEstimate({
  distance_m: distance_m,
  make: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Corolla',
  year: 1995
});

// Retrieve an estimate
const estimateId = 'est_test_1234';
patch.estimates.retrieveEstimate(estimate_id);

// Retrieve a list of estimates
const page = 1; // Pass in which page of estimates you'd like
patch.estimates.retrieveEstimates({ page });
```

### Projects

Projects are the ways Patch takes CO2 out of the air. They can represent reforestation, enhanced weathering, direct air carbon capture, etc. When you place an order via Patch, it is allocated to a project.

When fetching Projects, you can add filters to the query to narrow the result. Currently supported filters are:

- `country`
- `type`
- `minimumAvailableMass`

[API Reference](https://docs.patch.io/#/?id=projects)

#### Examples

```javascript
// Retrieve a project
const projectId = 'pro_test_1234'; // Pass in the project's ID
patch.projects.retrieveProject(projectId);

// Retrieve a list of projects
const page = 1; // Pass in which page of projects you'd like
patch.projects.retrieveProjects({ page });

// Retrieve a filtered list of projects
const country = 'CA'; // Pass in the country you'd like to get projects from
patch.projects.retrieveProjects({ country });

// Retrieve a filtered list of projects
const type = 'biomass'; // Pass in the project type you'd like to filter by
patch.projects.retrieveProjects({ type });

// Retrieve a filtered list of projects
const minimumAvailableMass = 100; // Pass in the minimum available inventory the projects should have
patch.projects.retrieveProjects({ minimumAvailableMass });
```

### Preferences

Preferences are how you route your orders in Patch. If you don't have a preference, Patch will allocate your order to the least expensive option. If you do have a preference, all of your orders will be sent to that project. You can set your preferences via API, or through the [Patch Dashboard](https://dashboard.patch.io/projects).

[API Reference](https://docs.patch.io/#/?id=preferences)

#### Examples

```javascript
// Create a preference
const projectId = 'pro_test_1234'; // Pass in the project_id for your preference
patch.preferences.createPreference((project_id: projectId));

// Retrieve a preference
const preferenceId = 'pre_test_1234'; // Pass in the preferences's id
patch.preferences.retrievePreference(preferenceId);

// Delete a preference
const preferenceId = 'pre_test_1234'; // Pass in the preferences's id
patch.preferences.deletePreference(preferenceId);

// Retrieve a list of preferences
const page = 1; // Pass in which page of preferences you'd like
patch.preferences.retrievePreferences({ page });
```

## Development

### Build and manually test

To build and test the package locally, run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder with the compiled code. Next you want to link the package and use it in a different folder.

In the patch-node folder, run:

```sh
$ npm link
```

Navigate to a different, empty folder:

```sh
$ cd ..
$ mkdir test-patch-node
$ cd test-patch-node
```

In that repository, run the following command to use the locally built package:

```sh
$ npm link @patch-technology/patch
```

This will create a `node_modules` directory in your test repository which will symlink to your locally built package. To test out the package, open a node REPL and import the package and run some queries.

```sh
$ node
> const Patch = require('@patch-technology/patch')
> Patch.default(process.env.SANDBOX_API_KEY).projects.retrieveProjects().then((response) => console.log(response))
```

### Run the specs

Before running the tests, make sure you set the test API key! Please use test API keys and not production ones, they usually start with `key_test_`.

```sh
$ export SANDBOX_API_KEY=<PATCH_TEST_API_KEY>
```

Then you are ready to run the tests:

```sh
$ npm run test
```
